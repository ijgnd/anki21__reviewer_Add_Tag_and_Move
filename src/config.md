- if the deck name you set in `add_tags_and_change_deck__newdeck` or
`just_change_deck__newdeck` a new deck with such a name will
be created.
- The default value for "Just_add_tag__hotkey" was "7". This no longer 
works in Anki 2.1.20 or later which was released on 2020-02-14 because 
in 2.1.20 "7" means "jump forward 5 seconds in audio file".
