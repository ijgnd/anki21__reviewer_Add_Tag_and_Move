port of <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1521848036" rel="nofollow">Add Tag and Move</a> for 2.1. I changed the keyboard shortcuts so that they work in 2.1. 

you should also have a look the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/304770511" rel="nofollow">Quick tagging 2.1.</a>.

This add-on add four shortcuts to the reviewer:
- open a dialogue box where you chose which tag to add to the card, default key "0"
- add a predefined tag(s) to the card. The default key used to be "7" but since 2.1.20 "7" is used by Anki jump forward 5 seconds. 
- add a predefined tag(s) to the card and move it to a predefined deck, default key "8"
- move the card to a predefined deck, default key "9"
You can set the predefined tags and deck in the add-on settings via Main Window -&gt; Add-ons - "Add Tag and Move 2.1" -&gt; Config

If you find a bug report it at my <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki21__reviewer_Add_Tag_and_Move" rel="nofollow">github repo</a>. It should work, use this at your own risk.
