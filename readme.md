### add-on for anki 2.1

quick port of [Add Tag and Move](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1521848036) upon request [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ax2y2r/how_do_i_set_my_anki_deck_to_take_out_review/). 

I changed the keyboard shortcuts so that they work in 2.1. If you find a bug report it at [my github repo](https://github.com/ijgnd/anki21__Add_Tag_and_Move/issues). Use this at your own risk.

you should also have a look [Quick tagging 2.1](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/304770511).

#### Known Issues 

Since I don't mind these issues I won't adress them. But fixes are very welcome.

- What you see is not updated with the tags added. QuickTagging also doesn't update what you see. just using mw.reset() is not an option because then the reviewer will show a different card.
- if the deck you set in the settings does not exist, it will be created.
