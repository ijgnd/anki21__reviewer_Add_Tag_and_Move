### add-on for anki 2.1

quick port of [Add Tag and Move](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1521848036) upon request [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ax2y2r/how_do_i_set_my_anki_deck_to_take_out_review/). I don't use this add-on and just changed
the keyboard shortcuts so that they work in 2.1. I haven't verified that the rest works. 

Use this at your own risk!
